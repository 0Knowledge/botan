Version 1.9.7, 2010-04-27
----------------------------------------

Support reading SSLv2 client hellos in the TLS server, though SSLv2
itself is not and will not be supported.

Add support for the SEED TLS ciphersuites (:rfc:`4162`)

Add the Comb4P hash combiner function, descrbied in `Robust
Multi-Property Combiners for Hash Functions Revisited
<http://www.cdc.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/~alehmann/publications/MPRCombiners.pdf>`_. It
is a way of combining two n-bit hash functions to produce a 2n-bit
output that preserves the collision resistance and PRF properties of
the two hashes. This may be useful in applications which are very
concerned about hash functions being broken; for instance it allows
use of both SHA-512 and Skein-512, such that even if one remains
unbroken then the combination will also remain unbroken.

A bug in checking of 'raw' encoding signatures was fixed; verifying a
message with leading zero bytes would always fail, even if the
signature was actually valid.
