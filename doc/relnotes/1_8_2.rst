Version 1.8.2, 2009-04-07
----------------------------------------

Entropy polling/scanning for the PRNG has been sped up quite a bit,
mostly by removing redundant operations, as well as by maintaining a
target bit count to collect. Once this goal is reached, the poll is
stopped. Since entropy sources are scanned (more or less) in the order
fastest to slowest, this tends to improve the runtime of an entropy
poll quite noticably.

The GOST 34.11 hash function has been added. This hash function is
standardized in Russia, and uses the GOST 28147 block cipher as a
cryptographic component. RFC 4357 specifies a particular set of sboxes
for the GOST cipher for use in the 34.11 hash function. Adding support
for 34.11 required modifying the block cipher implementation, and it
now supports the standard 'test' sboxes as well as the RFC 4357
parameters. The so-called 'test' parameters are commonly used in other
GOST 28147 software implementations (such as in Crypto++ and
BeeCrypt), and, according to Wikipedia, are also used by the Russian
Central Bank. The previous implementation of GOST 28147 used a
completely non-standard set of sboxes. These sboxes are not supported
any longer.

A bug preventing ``botan-config`` from working properly on MacOS X was
fixed.
