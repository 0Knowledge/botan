Version 1.4.10, 2005-12-18
----------------------------------------

Added an implementation of KASUMI, the block cipher used in 3G phones

Refactored Pipe; output queues are now managed by a distinct class

Made certain Filter facilities only available to subclasses of Fanout_Filter

There is no longer any overhead in Pipe for a message that has been read out

It is now possible to generate RSA keys as small as 128 bits

Changed some of the core classes to derive from Algorithm as a virtual base

Changed Randpool to use HMAC instead of a plain hash as the mixing function

Fixed a bug in the allocators; found and fixed by Matthew Gregan

Enabled the use of binary file I/O, when requested by the application

The OpenSSL engine's block cipher code was missing some deallocation calls

Disabled the es_ftw module on NetBSD, due to header problems there

Fixed a problem preventing tm_hard from building on MacOS X on PowerPC

Some cleanups for the modules that use inline assembler

config.h is now stored in build/ instead of build/include/botan/

The header util.h was split into bit_ops.h, parsing.h, and util.h

Cleaned up some redundant include directives
