Version 1.8.12, 2011-06-20
----------------------------------------

Fix a memory leak in the constructors of DataSource_Stream and
DataSink_Stream which would occur if opening the file failed. (PR 144)

If EMSA3(Raw) was used for more than one signature, it would produce
incorrect output. This only affects situations where you would be
signing using EMSA3 but providing the hash value directly, which is
quite uncommon.

Fix the --enable-debug option to configure.py

Improve OS detection on Cygwin

Fix compilation under Sun Studio 12 on Solaris
