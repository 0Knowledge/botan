Version 1.9.17, 2011-04-29
----------------------------------------

Third release candidate for 1.10.0

The format preserving encryption method currently available was
presented in the header ``fpe.h`` and the functions ``fpe_encrypt``
and ``fpe_decrypt``. These were renamed as it is likely that other FPE
schemes will be included in the future. The header is now
``fpe_fe1.h``, and the functions are named ``fe1_encrypt`` and
``fe1_decrypt``. See :doc:`../../fpe` for more information.

New options to ``configure.py`` control what tools are used for
documentation generation. The ``--with-sphinx`` option enables using
Sphinx to convert ReST into HTML; otherwise the ReST sources are
installed directly. If ``--with-doxygen`` is used, Doxygen will run as
well. Documentation generation can be triggered via the ``docs``
target in the makefile; it will also be installed by the install
target on Unix. If the command ``sphinx-build`` is found in the path,
using Sphinx is enabled automatically.

A bug in 1.9.16 effectively disabled support for runtime CPU feature
detection on x86 under GCC in that release.

A mostly internal change, all references to "ia32" and "amd64" have
been changed to the vendor neutral and probably easier to understand
"x86-32" and "x86-64". For instance, the "mp_amd64" module has been
renamed "mp_x86_64", and the macro indicating x86-32 has changed
from ``BOTAN_TARGET_ARCH_IS_IA32`` to
``BOTAN_TARGET_ARCH_IS_X86_32``. The classes calling assembly have
also been renamed.

Similiarly to the above change, the AES implemenations using the
AES-NI instruction set have been renamed from AES_XXX_Intel to
AES_XXX_NI.

Systems that are identified as `sun4u` will default to compiling for
32-bit SPARCv9 code rather than 64-bit. This matches the still
common convention for 32-bit SPARC userspaces. If you want 64-bit
code on such as system, use ``--cpu=sparc64``.

Some minor fixes for compiling botan under the BeOS
clone/continuation `Haiku <http://haiku-os.org>`_.
