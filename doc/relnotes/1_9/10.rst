Version 1.9.10, 2010-08-12
----------------------------------------

Add a constant time AES implementation using SSSE3. This code is based
on `public domain assembly <http://crypto.stanford.edu/vpaes/>`_
written by Mike Hamburg and described in his CHES 2009 paper
"Accelerating AES with Vector Permute Instructions". In addition to
being constant time, it is also significantly faster than the
table-based implementation on some processors, especially recent Intel
processors.

Add support for loading new Engines at runtime. Currently only systems
that use ``dlopen``-style dynamic linking are supported.

Use GCC byteswap intrinsics where possible

Drop support for building with Python 2.4

Fix benchmarking of block ciphers in ECB mode

Consolidate the two x86 assembly engines

Rename S2K to PBKDF, though a typedef remains for backwards
compatability.
