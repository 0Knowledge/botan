Version 1.9.6, 2010-04-09
----------------------------------------

Numerous additions to the TLS implementation, including support for
TLS v1.1 and the server name indicator extension. Bugs in the server
implementation were fixed. Additionally a timing channel between the
CBC padding check and MAC verification that could be used to attack
TLS servers was avoided.
