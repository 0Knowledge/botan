Version 1.8.10, 2010-08-31
----------------------------------------

Switch default PKCS #8 encryption algorithm from 3DES to AES-256, and
increase default hash iterations from 2048 to 10000 in PBES1 and PBES2

Use small tables in the first round of AES, which makes some timing
and cache analysis attacks substantially more difficult.

Add PBKDF typedef and get_pbkdf for better compatability with 1.9

Add version of S2K::derive_key taking salt and iteration count

Enable the /proc-walking entropy source on NetBSD

Fix the doxygen makefile target
