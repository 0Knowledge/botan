Version 1.9.9, 2010-06-28
----------------------------------------

Add new X509::BER_encode and PKCS8::BER_encode

Give all Filter objects a name() function

Add Keyed_Filter::valid_iv_length. Previously, partially because there
was no such query mechanism, if a filter did not support IVs at all,
then calls to ``set_iv`` would be silently ignored. Now an exception
about the invalid IV length will be thrown.

Increase default iteration counts for private key encryption

Fix compilation of mp_asm64 on 64-bit MIPS with GCC 4.4 and later

Fix compilation under Apple's GCC 4.2

Expand and update the Doxygen documentation
