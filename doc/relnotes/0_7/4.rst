Version 0.7.4, 2001-07-15
----------------------------------------

New modules: Zlib, gettimeofday and x86 RTC timers, Unix I/O for Pipe

Fixed a vast number of errors in the config script/makefile/specfile

Pipe now has a stdio(3) interface as well as C++ iostreams

ARC4 supports skipping the first N bytes of the cipher stream (ala MARK4)

Bzip2 supports decompressing multiple concatenated streams, and flushing

Added a simple 'overall average' score to the benchmarks

Fixed a small bug in the POSIX timer module

Removed a very-unlikely-to-occur bug in most of the hash functions

filtbase.h now includes <iosfwd>, not <iostream>

Minor documentation updates
