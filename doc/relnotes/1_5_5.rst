Version 1.5.5, 2006-02-04
----------------------------------------

Fixed a potential infinite loop in the memory pool code (Matt Johnston)

Made Pooling_Allocator::Memory_Block an actual class of sorts

Some small optimizations to the division and modulo computations

Cleaned up the implementation of some of the BigInt operators

Reduced use of dynamic memory allocation in low-level BigInt functions

A few simplifications in the Randpool mixing function

Removed power(), as it was not particularly useful (or fast)

Fixed some annoying bugs in the benchmark code

Added a real credits file
