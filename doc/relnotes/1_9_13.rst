Version 1.9.13, 2011-02-19
----------------------------------------

A bug in how GOST 34.10 signatures were formatted which prevented
botan from being interoperable with other implementations, and
specifically how GOST is used in DNSSEC, was fixed.

The Keccak hash function was updated to the tweaked variant proposed
for round 3 of the NIST hash competition. This version is not
compatible with the previous algorithm.

Small integers in the BER/DER code classes are typed as ``size_t``
rather than ``u32bit``.

A new option ``--distribution-info`` was added to the configure
script. It allows the user building the library to set any
distribution-specific notes on the build, which are available as a
macro ``BOTAN_DISTRIBUTION_INFO``. The default value is
'unspecified'. If you are building an unmodified version of botan
(especially for distribution), and want to indicate to applications
that this is the case, consider using
``--distribution-info=pristine``. If you are making any patches or
modifications, it is recommended to use
``--distribution-info=[Distribution Name] [Version]``, for instance
``--distribution-info='FooNix 1.9.13-r3'``.

A bug that prevented the amalgamation build from working, and problems
preventing building using Clang 2.9 and Sun Studio 12 were fixed.
